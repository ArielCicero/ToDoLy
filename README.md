# ToDoLy
KTH Individual Project for the Software Development Academy



Short Project Description:

The ToDoLy App is a text based todo list application that allows a user to create
new tasks, assign them a title and due date, and choose a project for that task to
belong to. The user is also able to edit, mark as done or remove tasks.
When the user quits the App, its status is saved in a file, so the application will
restart with the former state restored.
